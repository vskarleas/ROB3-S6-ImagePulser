## Project Overview

This project was developed during the 6th semester under the **Robotics Engineering major**. The course included two main components: **Projet Imposé** and **Projet Imagination**.

### Projet Imposé
The **Projet Imposé** is a simple program designed to help students familiarize themselves with the OpenCV development environment.

### Projet Imagination
The **Projet Imagination** is a unique project, where each pair or group of three students (binome/trinome) was free to choose what they wanted to develop. 

The main objective of this project is to vectorize and simplify images obtained via a webcam using dynamic methods, particularly segment-based simplification. This process has several real-world applications such as:

- Contour detection for image analysis
- Geometric data compression and contour representation at different scales, useful in mapping and geographic information systems
- And more...
